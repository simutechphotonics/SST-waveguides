This example demonstrates how to setup strip waveguide simulations.
The simulation can be used to find optimal cross section dimensions for desired modes
at selected wavelengths.
The demo has two parts: 
1) Setup simulation using the lumerical GUI and lumerical scripted files
2) Using python to run the aforementioned scripts. Allows for gui-less simulation,
customizable data processing steps, and plotting capabilities via matplotlib.
